#"Simon Says" is a memory game where "Simon" outputs a sequence of 10 characters (R, G, B, Y) 
# and the user must repeat the sequence. Create a for loop that compares each character of the two strings.
#  For each matching character, add one point to user_score. Upon a mismatch, end the loop.

#Sample output with inputs: 'RRGBRYYBGY' 'RRGBBRYBGY'
#User score: 4

simon_pattern = input()
user_pattern = input()
user_score = 0

for i in range(len(simon_pattern)):
    if simon_pattern[i] == user_pattern[i]:
        user_score += 1
    else:
        break

print('User score:', user_score)
